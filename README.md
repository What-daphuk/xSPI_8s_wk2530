# xSPI_8s_wk2530
This repository contains Verilog modules for a simple, custom SPI-like protocol called xSPI. It provides a complete controller (master) and slave system, both implemented with finite state machines. The design handles basic command, address, and data transactions for read and write operations, serving as a clear example for serial communication.
